# MNIST
This program implements a Concurrent Neural Network that takes in 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits and classifies it as a zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or nine. It uses tensorflow and keras and numpy libraries to recognize an image and predict its digit through a deep learning technique.
